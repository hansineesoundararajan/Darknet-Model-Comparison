## 📂 Projects

### 🔐 [Darknet Model Comparison](./darknet-models/)
- **Goal:** Compare ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, etc.) for network traffic classification using the Darknet 2020 dataset.
- **Highlights:** Identifies which model performs best.

### 🚀 [Boosting Algorithm Comparison](./boosting-comparison/)
- **Goal:** Evaluate and compare boosting algorithms (e.g., AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) on a CCiDD dataset.
- **Highlights:** Explains the boosting performance on the dataset.
