# Darknet-Model-Comparison
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the classification of internet traffic using the Darknet 2020 dataset. The models are trained to distinguish between different types of traffic: Tor, non-Tor, VPN, and non-VPN.

The project includes:
Data preprocessing,
Feature selection,
Classification using multiple ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression),
Evaluation metrics and comparison.
